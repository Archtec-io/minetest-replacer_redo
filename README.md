replacers, but with fewer bugs and fewer "features"

the aim of this variant is to try to use the highest level APIs provided, to trigger all possible callbacks.

#### creaplacer

there's a special creative-only replacer. to get one, do `/giveme replacer:creaplacer`.

additional features of the creaplacer:
* points at liquid nodes
* longer range (10 nodes)
* copies/pastes node metadata
* can force-replace nodes (as long as they're not blacklisted or something)

#### debugger

a special creative-only inspector. to get one, do `/giveme inspector:debugger`.

basically, instead of just getting the name of nodes/entities, you can see all their metadata.
